													<p style={paddingBottom}>Rebecca Watson holds a business degree in Human Resources from Ohio University. For many years, she spent her time managing childcare programs. Eventually, she quit her job and focused solely on being a mother to her three children, Matt, Jack and Ella. She devoted much of her time to taking care of Matt, who has special needs by taking him to therapies and activities.  Now that heâ€™s older and much more independent, she was able to return to work.
